# R Tools for Visual Studio

THANK YOU for checking out this early version of R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). We’ve decided to make it available early so that we’ll have more time to address your feedback. As such, there are bugs and missing features, so please beware! This release is meant for evaluation purposes only and not for production use.

If you **already** have VS2015 with Update 1 installed and R installed, you can download RTVS from the link below - but we highly recommend following the [Installation guide](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/installation.html):

### Installer: [Download R Tools for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/rtvs-current)

### Docs: [RTVS Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/)

### Build: [Build instructions](RTVS/Build.md)
