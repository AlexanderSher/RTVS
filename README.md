# R Tools for Visual Studio

THANK YOU for checking out this early version of R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). We’ve decided to make it available early so that we’ll have more time to address your feedback. As such, there are bugs and missing features, so please beware! This release is meant for evaluation purposes only and not for production use.

### Installation

Do you already have **VS2015 with Update 1** installed **and a 64-bit R interpreter** installed?

If you do, then install RTVS:

* [Download and install R Tools for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/rtvs-current)

Otherwise please see the:

* [VS, RTVS and R Installation guide](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/installation.html)


### Documentation

The interim docs are available here:

* [RTVS Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/)


### Bugs and feature requests

Please file bugs and feature requests here on github.  If you have a favorite issue/feature, please thumbs up or comment on it.

Please use the **R Tools / Send Feedback / Send Frown** feature to send us the logs please (this feature will start your mail client or Exchange/Outlook, attach %TEMP%/RTVSLogs.zip, ask you to examine the contents, then send it to us).

If you need to reach the team, please use rtvsuserfeedback@microsoft.com.


### Support and roadmap

RTVS is created and fully supported by Microsoft (and the community!).  Currently support is via github and email but we hope to add more channels soon.

We are planning approximately monthly releases (bugs fixes and features) as we march toward 1.0 RTM later this calendar year.

If you'd like to see what features are likely to go in each milestone, you can filter the bug/feature list by that milestone.  If you have a key bug or feature that should be attended to, please thumbs up / comment on it.
