# R Tools for Visual Studio

THANK YOU for checking out this early version of R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). We’ve decided to make it available early so that we’ll have more time to address your feedback. As such, there are bugs and missing features, so please beware! This release is meant for evaluation purposes only and not for production use.
