Building all the docker images:
1. Login to rtools account using 'docker login'
2. Build the rtvsdbase image first (you have 'cd' into rtvsdbase directory):
    docker build -t rtools/rtvsdbase-ub1604:latest .
3. Build CRAN R images (you have to cd into the rtvsd3.*.* directory):
    e.g., docker build -t rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:latest .
          docker build -t rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:3.4.1 .
4. Build the MRO iamges (you have to cd into the rtvsdmro3.*.* directory):
    e.g., docker build -t rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:mrolatest .
          docker build -t rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:mro3.4.1 .
5. After all images are built test them using docker run. You should be able to run R, and check the version.
    e.g., docker run -it rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:latest bash
6. push the images using 'docker push':
    e.g., docker push rtools/rtvsd-ub1604:latest
